Development (Dev)

The code is well-structured, with clear variable names and concise functions.
You could add unit tests using a testing framework like `pytest` or `unittest`.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

You can integrate this code with CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions, CircleCI, or Travis CI to automate builds and deployments.

Also, you can create a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file for GitHub Actions:

Code Snippets

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install numpy pytest
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest .
```


Security (Sec)

You can modify the `kepler_orbit` function to include data validation:

Code Snippets

```python
def kepler_orbit(t, e, a, i, Omega):
    if t < 0 or t > 24 * 60:  # validate time value
        raise ValueError("Invalid time value")
    ...
```

Operations (Ops)


You can modify the `numerical_integration` function to include error handling:

Code Snippets

```python
def numerical_integration(t0, tf, dt):
    try:
        ...
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
```
You can also add logging mechanisms using a library like `logging`.

Also, you can modify the `numerical_integration` function to include logging:

Code Snippets

```python
import logging

def numerical_integration(t0, tf, dt):
    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    ...
    try:
        ...
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error: {e}")
```
