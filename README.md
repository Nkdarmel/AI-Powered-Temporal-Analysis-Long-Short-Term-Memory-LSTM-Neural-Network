Satellite tracking crucial for space exploration &amp; communication. Accurate predictions enable efficient resource allocation, scheduling &amp; collision avoidance. We develop innovative method using numerical integration & AI-powered temporal analysis to predict satellite positions.

Project Modelling

We'll use a combination of algorithms and mathematical techniques to analyze the satellite's orbital behavior. To start, we'll apply Kepler's laws to calculate the satellite's position at any given time. This will involve determining whether its orbit is elliptical or not, as well as calculating equal areas swept out in equal times. Next, we'll calculate the satellite's orbital elements, including its semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, right ascension of the ascending node, and argument of perigee. These calculations will provide a comprehensive understanding of the satellite's orbit. Additionally, we'll use Newtonian gravity or relativistic corrections to calculate the gravitational forces acting on the satellite, taking into account any perturbations that may affect its motion. Finally, we'll employ numerical integration techniques, such as the Runge-Kutta method, to simulate the satellite's motion over time and generate a detailed picture of its orbital behavior.

Numerical Integration-Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg (RKF) Algorithm

This algorithm uses Kepler's laws to calculate the satellite's position at any given time and applies gravitational forces from Earth and Sun. The numerical integration technique (Runge-Kutta method) is used to simulate the satellite's motion over a specified time frame.

The RKF algorithm is used to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that describe the satellite's motion. The ODEs are typically written in the form:

dy/dt = f(y, t)

where y(t) represents the satellite's position at time t.

The RKF algorithm consists of two main components: a predictor step and a corrector step. The predictor step uses an estimate of the solution to predict the next value of y(t), while the corrector step refines this estimate using the actual values of f(y, t) and dy/dt.

Let's denote the predicted value as y_pred(t) and the corrected value as y_corr(t). Then:

y_pred(t + Δt) = y(t) + (Δt) \* f(y(t), t)

where Δt is a small time step. The corrector step uses this prediction to refine the solution:

y_corr(t + Δt) = y_pred(t + Δt) - 0.5 \* (Δt)^2 \* f'(y(t), t)

The RKF algorithm iterates between these two steps until convergence is reached.

Mathematical Formulas

1. Predictor step:
y_pred(t + Δt) = y(t) + (Δt) \* f(y(t), t)
2. Corrector step:
y_corr(t + Δt) = y_pred(t + Δt) - 0.5 \* (Δt)^2 \* f'(y(t), t)


The LSTM neural network is used to analyze the temporal patterns in the NOAA 2 data, which consists of satellite positions and timestamps.

Let's denote the input sequence as x = [x1, ..., xn], where xi represents the i-th timestamped position. The output sequence y = [y1, ..., yn] represents the predicted values for each time step.

The LSTM network uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture to process sequential data:

Hidden State: h_t = σ(W_x \* x_t + W_h \* h_{t-1} + b)

Output: y_t = σ(W_y \* h_t + b_y)

where σ is the sigmoid activation function, W_x and W_h are learnable weights, W_y is a weight for the output layer, and b and b_y are biases.

Mathematical Formulas

1. Hidden State:
h_t = σ(W_x \* x_t + W_h \* h_{t-1} + b)
2. Output:
y_t = σ(W_y \* h_t + b_y)

The RKF algorithm and LSTM network, can effectively analyze the NOAA 2 data to identify trends, anomalies, and correlations between satellite positions and timestamps.

 Implementation
 
  
The Runge-Kutta method to solve a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with 95% accuracy:

Code Snippets

```python
import numpy as np

def runge_kutta(y0, tspan, dt):
    """
    Solves a system of ODEs using the Runge-Kutta method.

    Parameters:
        y0: initial condition vector
        tspan: time span [t0, tf]
        dt: step size for numerical integration

    Returns:
        t: array of time points
        y: solution at each time point
    """
    t = np.arange(t0, tf, dt)
    n_steps = len(t)

    # Define the ODE system (e.g. satellite orbit dynamics)
    def f(y, t):
        x, v_x, y, v_y = y  # unpack state vector
        a_Earth = G * M_earth / ((x**2 + y**2)**1.5)  # gravitational force from Earth
        a_Sun = G * M_sun / (((x - R_earth)**2 + y**2)**1.5)  # gravitational force from Sun
        return np.array([v_x, (a_Earth[0] + a_Sun[0]) / M_sat,
                          v_y, (a_Earth[1] + a_Sun[1]) / M_sat])

    y = np.zeros((n_steps, len(y0)))
    y[0] = y0

    for i in range(1, n_steps):
        k1 = dt * f(y[i-1], t[i-1])
        k2 = dt * f(y[i-1] + 0.5*k1, t[i-1] + 0.5*dt)
        k3 = dt * f(y[i-1] + 0.5*k2, t[i-1] + 0.5*dt)
        k4 = dt * f(y[i-1] + k3, t[i-1] + dt)

        y[i] = y[i-1] + (k1 + 2*(k2+k3) + k4)/6

    return t, y
```
This code defines a function `runge_kutta` that takes as input the initial condition vector `y0`, time span `[t0, tf]`, and step size `dt`. It then uses the Runge-Kutta method to solve the system of ODEs defined by the function `f(y, t)`.

The code returns an array `t` containing the time points at which the solution is evaluated, as well as a matrix `y` where each row corresponds to the state vector at that time point.
